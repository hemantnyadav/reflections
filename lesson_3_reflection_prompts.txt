When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we need multiple people to collaborate and work on same files it is good idea to make them remote rather than to kwwp them all in local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In a collaborative project it needed to monitor changes from other people to remote and also some changes shuld not be updated on remote before verification. So Automatic update is not right choice.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is limited to github only and used to create clone on any repository on github
    clones used to make remote repository to local
    branches are used for working on same repository but by multiple people/projects


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This will be helpful in merging

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without using git or github we need to share common files via google cloud.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
